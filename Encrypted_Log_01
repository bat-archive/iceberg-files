**🕵️ INTEL REPORT 014 — DECRYPTED EXCERPT**
**Source** : **Arkham Intel Archives**
**Subject** : **Oswald Cobblepot**
**Alias** : **The Penguin**

📰 Summary :
After the Knightfall Protocol was initiated, various Gotham syndicates started moving again. One name, long thought dormant, began resurfacing in closed channels — Oswald Cobblepot.

Security intercepts show repeated use of the term **“iceberg_ops”**, traced back to an old comms node once used by Penguin’s network. Matching voiceprint analysis confirms the user refers to himself consistently as **“oswaldpenguin”**.

Further digging revealed a hidden data packet tagged **“c0bbleR3turns”**, believed to be the codename for Penguin’s latest resurgence strategy — a sequence of coordinated moves involving his signature fashion contacts and underworld influence. Analysts warn this operation could destabilize the fragile power balance in Gotham.

Passwords uncovered in legacy systems include references to his criminal resurgence, fashion, and his signature waddle. One string matched to his encrypted notes appears repeatedly — a final key, accessible only through secured channels, awaiting those who know where to connect.
